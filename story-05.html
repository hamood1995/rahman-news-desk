    <p>
      Firefighters responded to reports of a basement fire at a two-story
      attached private dwelling on Eldert Lane in Brooklyn during the
      evening hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      FDNY units arrived on scene to find smoke coming from the structure
      and stretched lines to the basement to attack the fire. Due to the
      attached nature of the homes, crews worked aggressively to prevent
      extension into neighboring buildings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional units were assigned as a precaution while firefighters
      searched the structure and confirmed all occupants were safely out.
      The fire was brought under control following sustained operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      No serious injuries were reported. The cause of the fire remains
      under investigation.
