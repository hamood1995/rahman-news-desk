      <!-- STORY TEXT -->
      <p>
        A city-permitted television production brought overnight parking restrictions to sections of Flatbush Avenue as crews prepared for filming under authorization from New York City agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bright pink “No Parking – Film Shoot” notices were posted along the block advising residents that vehicles would be relocated or towed if not moved during the designated time window. The notices were issued through the City of New York’s Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment and displayed NYPD authorization with instructions directing residents to call 311 for vehicle relocation information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Production equipment trucks, lighting rigs, and crew support vehicles were staged curbside as preparations continued throughout the evening. Parking enforcement and traffic management were coordinated in accordance with city filming regulations to maintain public safety and access for residents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Film and television shoots across New York City frequently require temporary street and parking restrictions, which are implemented under city-issued permits and coordinated with law enforcement to manage traffic flow and pedestrian safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        No injuries or disruptions beyond the posted parking restrictions were reported during the filming setup period.
