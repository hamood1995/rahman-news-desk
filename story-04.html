      <p>
        A city-permitted television production brought overnight parking restrictions
        to sections of Flatbush Avenue as crews prepared for filming under authorization
        from New York City agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bright pink “No Parking – Film Shoot” notices were posted along the block advising
        residents that vehicles would be relocated or towed if not moved during the
        designated time window. The notices were issued through the City of New York’s
        Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment and displayed NYPD authorization with
        instructions directing residents to call 311 for vehicle relocation information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Production equipment trucks, lighting rigs, and crew support vehicles were staged
        curbside as preparations continued throughout the evening. Parking enforcement
        and traffic management were coordinated in accordance with city filming
        regulations to maintain public safety and access for residents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Film and television shoots across New York City frequently require temporary
        street and parking restrictions, which are implemented under city-issued permits
        and coordinated with law enforcement.
      </p>

      <p>
        No injuries or disruptions beyond the posted parking restrictions were reported
        during the setup period.
