      <p>
        A school bus caught fire during school hours after it was initially observed emitting smoke
        in Ozone Park, Queens, on April 1, 2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        The incident occurred near the intersection of 80th Street and 97th Avenue. As conditions
        escalated from smoke to visible fire, the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) was notified
        and responded promptly to the scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        FDNY firefighters arrived, stretched hose lines, and brought the fire under control.
        The bus was secured, and the scene was stabilized. No injuries were reported in connection
        with the incident.
      </p>

      <p>
        The response prevented the fire from spreading and ensured public safety in the surrounding
        residential area.
